## Why?

We have all experienced working at an organisation where communication,
delegation and follow-through were *sub-optimal*.

***tudo*** is our quest to help *all* organisations have a
"[***Single version of the truth***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)""
which is *always* consistent, version-controlled (*full audit/history*),
transparent and real-time.


### Required Environment Variables

To run this app you will need to set the following
[environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable):

+ PORT
+ GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
+ GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

#### Local Machine (_use an `env.json` file_)

On your personal development machine
you can use an `env.json` file to store these environment variables,
create a file called env.json and put it at the root of the project.

This repo contains a sample file: `env.json_sample` which you can copy:
```sh
cp env.json_sample env.json
```
And then change the values as required.
(aksk @iteles for access to the Google Doc with our env.json )

#### Deploying on Heroku

To deploy to Heroku you will need to add the environment variables _manually_ (_once_)

## Github API - issues

You will temporarily need a env.json file (like below) to run this code.
```
{
    "GHAPIKEY": "your personal acccess token"
}
```
The only issues you will be able to get (for now) are issues assigned to you by visiting localhost:8000/issues

This begins our exploration into the Github API - Issues.

Issues will be returned in an array. If you would like to see  an example of an issue then checkout the exampleIssue.json provided.
