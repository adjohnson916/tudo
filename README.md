# tudo

A single version of the truth with integrated task tracking, delegation and accountability.

## Why?

We have all experienced working at an organisation where communication,
delegation and follow-through were *sub-optimal*.

***tudo*** is our quest to help *all* organisations have a
"[***Single version of the truth***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)""
which is *always* consistent, version-controlled (*full audit/history*),
transparent and real-time.
