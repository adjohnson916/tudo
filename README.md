# tudo

A single version of the truth with integrated task tracking, delegation and accountability.

## Why?

We have all experienced working at an organisation where communication,
delegation and follow-through were *sub-optimal*.

***tudo*** is our quest to help *all* organisations have a
"[***Single version of the truth***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)""
which is *always* consistent, version-controlled (*full audit/history*),
transparent and real-time.

###Front-end
**20150720:** @msmichellegar, @iteles and Anneka S brainstormed on some front-end visuals and created some simple wireframes:

#####Greatest challenge:
+ What is the ideal user flow throughout the app?  
+ How do we ensure that issues are _not_ buried more than 1 click deep?    

Earlier conversations yielded many different priorities when using Github issues so understanding what would be useful as a **default homepage** (prior to adding _customisation of content_) was challenging!

#####Cards vs rows
Many conversations were had on this visual difference between items as 'cards' or items as 'rows'.

Our conclusion was that _cards_ encourage people to move them around and provide a greater visual differentiation between the various items. Still debating where this is most appropriate!

#####Favouriting
Favourited items get pinned to the top of the screen for MVP (until we can create our own task list from favourites/pins).

#####Unread issues
Unread issues appear in **bold**, but **under** your favourites.
