# tudo

A single version of the truth with integrated task tracking, delegation and accountability.

## Why?

We have all experienced working at an organisation where communication,
delegation and follow-through were *sub-optimal*.

***tudo*** is our quest to help *all* organisations have a
"[***Single version of the truth***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)""
which is *always* consistent, version-controlled (*full audit/history*),
transparent and real-time.

## Github API - issues

You will temporarily need a config.json file (like below) to run this code.
```
{
    "GHAPIKEY": "your personal acccess token"
}
```
The only issues you will be able to get (for now) are issues assigned to you by visiting localhost:8000/issues

This begins our exploration into the Github API - Issues.

Issues will be returned in an array. If you would like to see  an example of an issue then checkout the exampleIssue.json provided.
