# tudo

A single version of the truth with integrated task tracking, delegation and accountability.

## Why?

We have all experienced working at an organisation where communication,
delegation and follow-through were *sub-optimal*.

***tudo*** is our quest to help *all* organisations have a
"[***Single version of the truth***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)""
which is *always* consistent, version-controlled (*full audit/history*),
transparent and real-time.

###Front-end
**20150720:** @msmichellegar, @iteles and Anneka S brainstormed on some front-end visuals and created some simple wireframes:

#####Challenges:
+ What is the ideal user flow throughout the app? How do typical people (technical and non-technical) find the issues they're looking for?  
+ How do we ensure that issues are _not_ buried **more than 1 click deep**?    

Earlier conversations yielded many different priorities when using Github issues so understanding what would be useful as a **default homepage** (prior to adding _customisation of content_) was interesting.     
We agreed that **for now we would start with a stripped down version** that shows two things:
+ A list of issues as seen by a person when they go to http://github.com/issues
+ One additional view, filtering all issues assigned to the login in person

_Features such as search, prioritisation, creation of issues and creation of labels, etc will be added as they are agreed on by the group at [#dwylsummer](https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015)._

#####Cards vs rows
Many conversations were had on this visual difference between items as 'cards' or items as 'rows'.

_Cards_ encourage people to move them around and provide a greater visual differentiation between the various items. This will only become relevant if issues can be picked up and moved around to redetermine prioritisation.
